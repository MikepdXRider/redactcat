# redactcat

A production-grade FastAPI service for redacting PII from documents. Users submit text, PDFs, or images; AWS Comprehend detects PII entities; users review and confirm suggested redactions; the service delivers a permanently redacted output. All job data is ephemeral — deleted after download.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Framework | FastAPI | Async-ready, OpenAPI docs out of the box, first-class dependency injection |
| ORM | SQLAlchemy 2.0 | `Mapped`/`mapped_column` declarative syntax, explicit session control |
| Auth | PyJWT + bcrypt | passlib is incompatible with bcrypt 5.x; rolling own keeps the dependency surface minimal |
| Validation | Pydantic v2 | Co-designed with FastAPI; field-level constraints enforced at the request boundary |
| Package management | uv | Near-instant installs, lockfile determinism, replaces pip + venv |
| Linting | Ruff | Single tool replaces flake8, isort, and pyupgrade |
| Testing | pytest + SQLite in-memory | Fast, fully isolated, no external services required for CI |
| PII detection | AWS Comprehend | Managed NLP; sync API handles up to 100KB inline with no infrastructure to maintain |
| File extraction | PyMuPDF + Textract | PyMuPDF for text-native PDFs; Textract for scanned PDFs and images |
| Redaction | PyMuPDF | `add_redact_annot` + `apply_redactions` produces permanent, non-reversible redaction |
| File storage | S3 (ephemeral) | Files deleted immediately after download; presigned URLs for secure delivery |

## Architecture Decisions

**Stateless JWT + rotating refresh tokens**
Access tokens are short-lived JWTs (30min) with no server-side storage. Refresh tokens are opaque strings stored in the `refresh_tokens` table. Each `/auth/refresh` call rotates the pair — the old row is deleted and a new token pair is issued. Logout is a single DB delete. This avoids a token blacklist while giving stolen refresh tokens only a one-use window before detection.

**Naive UTC datetimes**
All datetimes are computed in UTC and stored timezone-naive (`datetime.now(UTC).replace(tzinfo=None)`). SQLite has no native timezone support; PostgreSQL `TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE` accepts naive values. The UTC convention is enforced at the application layer — no mixed-offset data enters the DB.

**Cross-user isolation via 404**
Endpoints that access user-owned resources raise `404` (not `403`) when a resource exists but belongs to another user. This avoids confirming resource existence to unauthorized callers.

**Ephemeral job storage**
Job files are deleted from S3 immediately after the user downloads the redacted output. The only persistent record is a `UsageEvent` row with aggregate stats (no PII). This limits data retention exposure and eliminates a class of compliance risk.

**Single `models.py` and `schemas.py`**
All ORM models and Pydantic schemas live in one file each. This avoids circular imports, makes the full data model visible at a glance, and keeps `Base.metadata.create_all` deterministic.

**Direct bcrypt (no passlib)**
passlib's bcrypt backend raises a `ValueError` on initialization against bcrypt 5.x (removed `__about__` attribute, strict 72-byte enforcement). bcrypt is used directly via `hashpw`/`checkpw`.

## API Reference

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| GET | /health | — | Health check |
| POST | /auth/register | — | Register and auto-login; returns access + refresh token pair |
| POST | /auth/login | — | Login with credentials; returns token pair |
| POST | /auth/logout | ✓ | Delete refresh token row; invalidates session |
| POST | /auth/refresh | — | Rotate refresh token; returns new token pair |
| GET | /users/me | ✓ | Get current user profile |
| PATCH | /users/me | ✓ | Update email or password |
| DELETE | /users/me | ✓ | Delete account and all active sessions |

## Quickstart

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Copy and fill in environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Start the dev server
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Lint
uv run ruff check .
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | No | `sqlite:///./redactcat.db` | SQLAlchemy connection string |
| `APP_ENV` | No | `development` | `development` or `production` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | **Yes** | — | Secret for signing JWTs (32+ chars); app will not start without it |
| `JWT_ALGORITHM` | No | `HS256` | JWT signing algorithm |
| `JWT_EXPIRE_MINUTES` | No | `30` | Access token lifetime in minutes |
| `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS` | No | `30` | Refresh token lifetime in days |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Yes† | — | AWS credentials |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Yes† | — | AWS credentials |
| `AWS_REGION` | Yes† | — | AWS region (e.g. `us-east-1`) |
| `S3_BUCKET` | Yes† | — | S3 bucket for ephemeral job file storage |

†Required for job features (Comprehend, Textract, S3). Auth endpoints run locally without AWS credentials.

## How It Works

1. **Submit** — user POSTs text or uploads a file (PDF, image)
2. **Detect** — AWS Comprehend scans for PII entities; Textract extracts text from scanned files
3. **Review** — API returns detected entities with locations for user confirmation
4. **Redact** — user submits confirmed entity IDs; service applies permanent redactions via PyMuPDF
5. **Deliver** — user downloads the redacted output; all job data and S3 objects are deleted

## AI-Assisted Development

This project uses [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) as a development tool. Every change — architecture decisions, implementation, tests, and documentation — is reviewed and approved by the developer before it is committed. The expectation is that the developer can explain any decision, trade-off, or line of code in the repository.

The workflow is deliberate: plan the approach, implement, review the diff, run tests, then commit. AI accelerates execution but does not replace engineering judgment — all technical decisions and their rationale are documented in the Architecture Decisions section of this README and in `CLAUDE.md`.
